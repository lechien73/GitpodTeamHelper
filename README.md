# Gitpod Team Helper Extension

## What is it?

A Chrome/Brave extension to make administering the Code Institute Gitpod team easier.

Firstly, it adds text to the **Manage Teams** modal so that it lists our total active and total inactive users.

Secondly, it highlights inactive users in green, making them easier to see as you scroll.

## How do I install it?

It's a bit specialised so it's not in the extension store. You'll need to sideload it.

1. Download this repo locally and unzip it
2. Go to the Extensions screen in Chrome or Brave
3. Click on the *Developer Mode* button
4. Click on *Load Unpacked*
5. Load the extension from the folder you downloaded

## Privacy & Security

The extension only works on the gitpod.io/teams page. It only stores enabled/disabled data - nothing else. It's as safe as houses.

## Todo

I want to add the option to hide and reveal active users, which I think would make it more useful, but that's for a bit later.

Icons, maybe...

## Can I contribute?

You betcha! Make your wondrous changes and submit a PR and I will be eternally grateful until I forget.
